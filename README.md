# CS-Final-Streamlit-Project
A Streamlit project that I made for my final project for CAP4104 at FIU.

This project was made in tandem with Streamlit. It reads an API dump that has a large amount of information about over a thousand different species of Pokémon.

The project was made in order to create an application that has a wide selection of interactive buttons and menus in which the user can use to learn about different Pokémon and the intricacies of the game.

I have to figure out how to run it again because it has been a long time since I ran the code.
